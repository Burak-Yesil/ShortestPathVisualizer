# ShortestPathVisualizer
In this project, I made a program that helps us get a visual representation of the A-star pathfinding algorithm. 
To use the program, place two blocks by clicking on the graph at two separate locations and then place black blocks as barriers. Once you are done placing barrier blocks click the space bar and watch the program run. Once the program is done running it will draw out a purple path indicating the shortest path. To exit the program click the exit button on the window.
